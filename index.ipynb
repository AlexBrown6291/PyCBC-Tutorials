    "\n",
    "PyCBC is software developed by a collaboration of LIGO scientists. It is open source and freely available. We use PyCBC in the detection of gravitational waves from binary mergers such as GW150914. Below you will find links to examples that explore gravitational wave data, how we find potential signals, and learn about them. This notebook is interactive so feel free to modify yourself!\n",
